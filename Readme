This is a C++ implementation of scalable DBSCAN and its OPTICS, called sDBSCAN, in high dimensional space

sDBSCAN uses FFHT (Fast Fast Hadamard Transform) (https://github.com/FALCONN-LIB/FFHT) that provides a heavily optimized C99 implementation of the Fast Hadamard Transform.
It uses AVX to speed up the computation. This lib is part of FalconnLib

sDBSCAN also needs EigenLib (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) with vectorization to fast compute distance
and boost (https://www.boost.org/) with binary histogram

See the Compile.sh for compiling and running
